# Titanic
First entry to the Kaggle Titanic competition. Will update if I get better results.

Accuracy 0.80382, currently ranked top 12% out of 11246 teams/users on the leaderboard (User: Gilbert Jiang)

Notebook Titanic-RGBT2 uses Random Gradient Boosted trees with the following features:
['PassengerId', 'Survived', 'Age', 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'SibSp', 'Parch','Fare','Embarked']

*** Disclaimer ***
Because the Titanic dataset is publically available on the internet, looking up the answers is possible but defeats the entire purpose. So keep that in mind while reviewing the leaderboard.
